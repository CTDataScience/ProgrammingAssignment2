### Introduction

Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

### Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## Week 3 Assignment - Pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix

## makeCacheMatrix - This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if (!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
